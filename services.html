              <p>
                If you miss checking essential tenant screening background records, your mistake could cost you a lot in the future. It may be compared to a loss of income or a stressful eviction. Knoxville Property Management LLC can conduct a comprehensive screening of any potential tenant. This screening would provide detailed information such as the financial capacity of the tenant, criminal record, and prior references to landlords. 
                Our aim is to find tenants for your property who are financially sound, responsible, and policy-abiding. Knoxville Property Management LLC is focused on protecting our clients from costly evictions and legal headaches that come from problematic tenants by being the best realtor in Knoxville, Tennessee. 
                To ensure your property remains in good shape and your tenants are taken care of, much of our role as your property manager will lie in property repair and maintenance. Our aim is to make tenants satisfied with the property so that when the time comes, they can renew their leases. This can, in fact, help you optimize your ROI.
                Rent collection is where the ROI is received by a property owner. This will result in delayed revenue if your rent collection is inefficient. An efficient system has been developed by Knoxville Property Management that offers several payment options for tenants. This way, in whatever way suits their needs best, tenants will conveniently pay on time. Using an automated fund transfer, we then easily credit the accounts of our customers with their rental income. 
                With an x-month reimbursement guarantee in the event of an eviction, we cover each of our customers. We will not charge our customers any tenant replacement fees if we have to evict a tenant within this time period.
