        <h2>Property Management</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Owners</h2>
        <p>
          It can be a lucrative investment to own a residential rental property,
          but it also brings with it its share of headaches and concerns. It
          will save you a lot of time and money to find a professional Knoxville
          Tennessee residential property manager and realtor. You get much more
          than just one overworked property manager with our full-service

        </p>
        <h2>Tentants</h2>
        <p>
          If you miss checking essential tenant screening background records,
          your mistake could cost you a lot in the future. It may be compared to
          a loss of income or a stressful eviction. Knoxville Property
          Management LLC can conduct a comprehensive screening of any potential
          tenant. This screening would provide detailed information such as the
          financial capacity of the tenant, criminal record, and prior
          references to landlords. Our aim is to find tenants for your property
          who are financially sound, responsible, and policy-abiding. Knoxville
          Property Management LLC is focused on protecting our clients from
          costly evictions and legal headaches that come from problematic
          tenants by being the best realtor in Knoxville, Tennessee. To ensure
          your property remains in good shape and your tenants are taken care
          of, much of our role as your property manager will lie in property
          repair and maintenance. Our aim is to make tenants satisfied with the
          property so that when the time comes, they can renew their leases.
          This can, in fact, help you optimize your ROI. Rent collection is
          where the ROI is received by a property owner. This will result in
          delayed revenue if your rent collection is inefficient. An efficient
          system has been developed by Knoxville Property Management that offers
          several payment options for tenants. This way, in whatever way suits
          their needs best, tenants will conveniently pay on time. Using an
          automated fund transfer, we then easily credit the accounts of our
          customers with their rental income. With an x-month reimbursement
          guarantee in the event of an eviction, we cover each of our customers.
          We will not charge our customers any tenant replacement fees if we
          have to evict a tenant within this time period.
